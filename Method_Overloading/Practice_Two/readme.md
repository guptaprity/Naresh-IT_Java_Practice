# 🔷 Java Method Overloading – Shape Calculator

This project demonstrates **Method Overloading** in Java by calculating the area of different geometric shapes using the same method name `calculateArea` with different parameter lists.

---

## 📌 Assignment Description
Implement a `ShapeCalculator` class with **overloaded methods** to calculate the area of:
- **Square** → `calculateArea(int side)`
- **Rectangle** → `calculateArea(int length, int width)`
- **Circle** → `calculateArea(double radius)`

Then use an `ELC` class (`DemoShapeCalculator`) to test these methods.

---



## ⚙️ Features
- 📐 **Square** → Area = side × side  
- 🟦 **Rectangle** → Area = length × width  
- ⚪ **Circle** → Area = π × radius × radius  

---

## 🧾 Test Case (Given)
Area of the Square :81
Area of the Rectangle :120
Area of the Circle is 32.15





## 📚 Concepts Used
Method Overloading

OOP in Java

✨ Output from My Code

Area of the Square :81
Area of the Rectangle :120
Area of the Circle is 32.169908772759484
