# 🧮 Java Method Overloading – Calculator

This project demonstrates **Method Overloading** in Java using a simple `Calculator` class to perform arithmetic operations such as **addition** and **multiplication** with both `int` and `double` arguments.

---

## 📌 Assignment Description
You are required to implement a Java program that defines a calculation of two numbers with method overloading.  
The program should handle both integer and double values.

---



---

## ⚙️ Features
- `add(int num1, int num2)` → Returns sum of two integers  
- `add(double num1, double num2)` → Returns sum of two doubles  
- `multiply(int num1, int num2)` → Returns product of two integers  
- `multiply(double num1, double num2)` → Returns product of two doubles

## 🧾 Test Case (Given)
Sum of two integer is :36
Sum of two double is :37.57
...........................
Multiplication of two integer is :72
Multiplication of two double is :6.6
