# ðŸ“˜ Java OOPs Concepts â€“ Aggregation & Composition

This repository demonstrates two important **HAS-A relationships** in Java:  

- **Aggregation (Weak HAS-A Relationship)**  
- **Composition (Strong HAS-A Relationship)**  

Both projects are implemented in Java using **Eclipse IDE**.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

### âœ… Aggregation (Weak HAS-A Relationship)
- Example: **Student HAS-A College**  
- Both objects can exist independently  
- One college object can be shared by multiple students  

### âœ… Composition (Strong HAS-A Relationship)
- Example: **Car HAS-A Engine**  
- Engine is created inside the Car and cannot exist without the Car  
- Strong dependency between objects
