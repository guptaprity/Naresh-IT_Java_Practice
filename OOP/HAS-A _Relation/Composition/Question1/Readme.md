# ðŸš— Java Composition Example â€“ HAS-A Strong Relationship

This project demonstrates the concept of **Composition in Java**, a special type of **HAS-A relationship**.  
In **Composition**, one class is strongly dependent on another, meaning the contained object cannot exist without the container.  

Example:  
- A **Car HAS-A Engine**.  
- If the car object is destroyed, the engine object is also destroyed.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned from This Project

- **Composition (Strong HAS-A Relationship)**  
  - `Car` contains an `Engine` object.  
  - The `Engine` is created inside the `Car` constructor and cannot exist without the `Car`.  

- **Class and Object Creation**  
  - Created classes (`Car`, `Engine`, `CompositionDemo`) and objects using the `new` keyword.  

- **Final Keyword Usage**  
  - Declared the `engine` reference as `final` to ensure the engine always belongs to the car.  

- **Constructor Initialization**  
  - Engine is created automatically when a `Car` is created â†’ Strong dependency.  

- **toString() Method Overriding**  
  - Overridden in both `Car` and `Engine` classes to display details in a readable format.
