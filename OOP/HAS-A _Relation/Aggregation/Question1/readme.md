# ðŸ“˜ Java Aggregation Example â€“ HAS-A Relationship

This project demonstrates the concept of **Aggregation in Java**, also known as the **HAS-A relationship**.  
Aggregation represents a relationship where one class contains a reference to another class, but both can exist independently.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned from This Project

- **Aggregation (HAS-A Relationship)**  
  A **Student HAS-A College**. Both `Student` and `College` can exist independently.  
  â†’ Example of real-world mapping.

- **Class and Object Creation**  
  Created multiple classes (`College`, `Student`, `Aggregation`) and objects using the `new` keyword.

- **Constructors**  
  Used constructors to initialize values when objects are created.

- **toString() Method Overriding**  
  Overridden in both `Student` and `College` classes to display object details instead of memory addresses.

- **Reusability**  
  One `College` object can be shared by multiple `Student` objects.
