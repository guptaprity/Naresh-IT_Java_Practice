# Assignment 01 - Abstract Class `Shape`

This project demonstrates the use of **abstract classes** and **method overriding** in Java.  
It defines an abstract class `Shape` with two abstract methods, and three concrete subclasses: `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle`.  
Each subclass provides its own implementation of calculating area and printing details.
